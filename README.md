# dvd-rw

Speed-optimized request recording and replaying for HTTPX.

dvd-rw aims to provide a vcrpy-like workflow with a focus on high scalability: efficient lookups and minimal overhead
when recording/replaying thousands of requests. Core components use Pydantic v2 models for structured data and JSON
serialization. A keyed index enables O(1)-ish replay lookups.

## Why dvd-rw?

If your use-case fits the request-replay features of the vcr(py), library, but you need faster performance,
dvd-rw provides:

- Fast lookups via a keyed index; only a small bucket is scanned per request
- Built in matchers (host, query, ...) are provided in a performance-optimized manner
- DVD loading is optimized for speed by leveraging Pydantic where possible

## Next Steps

The current version has minimal functionality: only HTTPX support, no cassette modes, etc...

The next versions are focused on improving the experience for my primary use case, testing:

- PyTest integration (through a fixture and mark) to save DVDs for given test(s), allowing you to run against a real
  server once, and store the results for the next test run
    - A PyTest hook to only save the dvd in case of a successful test
- Filtering which requests/request parts to store (functionality similar to before record request/response in vcrpy)

Long-term, I want to keep performance as a main goal:

- Reduce dvd file size when saved through compression, if this is possible in a performant manner
- Move file IO into rust

## Installation

Using uv (preferred):

```
uv pip install -e . --group dev
```

Notes:

- -e installs in editable mode for local development.
- --group dev will include pytest for running the test suite.

Using pip (alternative):

```
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e .
python -m pip install pytest
```

## Quickstart

### Record and replay programmatically

```python
from dvd_rw.models import DVD, Request, Response, Matcher

# Configure the matchers to use for indexing and equality checks
match_on = [Matcher.host, Matcher.method, Matcher.path, Matcher.query]

dvd = DVD(
    recorded_requests=[],
    from_file=False,  # new in-memory recording
    match_on=match_on,
)

# Construct request/response models directly
req = Request(headers=[], method="GET", url="https://example.com/items?id=1")
res = Response(status=200, headers=[("content-type", "application/json")], body=b"ok")

# Record
dvd.record_request(req, res)

# Replay (each recorded pair is returned at most once by default)
assert dvd.get_response(req) == res
assert dvd.get_response(req) is None
```

### Persist to disk with DVDLoader

```python
from dvd_rw.loader import DVDLoader
from dvd_rw.models import Matcher

with DVDLoader(
        file_path="/tmp/example.dvd.json",
        match_on=[Matcher.host, Matcher.method, Matcher.path, Matcher.query],
        extra_matchers=[],
) as dvd:
    # If the file did not exist yet, dvd.from_file will be False (recording allowed)
    # On subsequent runs when the file exists, dvd.from_file will be True (replay only)
    ...
```

DVDLoader only saves on successful exit when changes were made (tracked via dvd.dirty). If the DVD was loaded from
file (from_file=True), calling dvd.record_request raises CannotRecord to prevent accidental writes.

### Transparent HTTPX integration (patcher)

You can activate a DVD for the current process so that httpx.Client and httpx.AsyncClient transparently record or
replay.

```python
import httpx
from dvd_rw.loader import DVDLoader
from dvd_rw.models import Matcher

with DVDLoader(
        file_path="/tmp/patcher-demo.dvd.json",
        match_on=[Matcher.host, Matcher.method, Matcher.path, Matcher.query],
        extra_matchers=[],
) as dvd:
    # In recording mode (no file yet): real requests are made and recorded
    with httpx.Client() as client:
        r = client.get("https://httpbin.org/get?x=1")
        assert r.status_code == 200

# Next run (file exists): replay mode, no network I/O; responses are returned from the recorded data.
with DVDLoader(
        file_path="/tmp/patcher-demo.dvd.json",
        match_on=[Matcher.host, Matcher.method, Matcher.path, Matcher.query],
        extra_matchers=[],
) as dvd:
    with httpx.Client() as client:
        r = client.get("https://httpbin.org/get?x=1")
        assert r.status_code == 200
```

Exception semantics: when recording, if an httpx request raises, the patcher records the exception class and message. On
replay, the same exception type is reconstructed and raised (falling back to httpx.RequestError if constructor
signatures donâ€™t match exactly). This is powered by RequestExceptionInfo in dvd_rw.models.

## Matching and performance

- Builtin matchers are both hashed (for indexing) and compared (for equality) using these features: host, method, path,
  query, headers, scheme.
- You can customize match_on to include only what you need; fewer, stable features yield smaller keys and fewer index
  buckets.
- extra_matchers is a list of callables taking (recorded_request, incoming_request) and returning bool, applied after
  the hash bucket filter.
- For high throughput:
    - Keep match_on minimal but sufficient (e.g., avoid headers if not necessary).
    - Prefer deterministic, immutable features; expensive computations will hurt performance.
    - The index stores per-bucket lists of (list_index, Request, Response|ExceptionInfo) for lightweight scans.

## Response selection semantics

DVD.get_response(request) returns the first matching response whose per-index _match_counts < 1, then increments. Each
recorded pair is therefore returned at most once by default. If you need cycling or multiple uses, adapt the logic or
build a higher-level helper.

To get exception replay behavior, use dvd.get_request(request), which either returns a Response, raises a reconstructed
exception, or returns None when no match.

## Serialization

Pydantic v2 is used for JSON serialization: model_dump_json() and model_validate_json(). Response.body is bytes | None;
it is encoded as base64 in JSON and decoded back to bytes on load.

## Running tests
